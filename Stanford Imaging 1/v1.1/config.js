// Keys for config dictionary:
// all_labels -> List of labels the model predicts for. In CheXpert's case, there are 14 diseases.
// labels -> The labels we wish to show predictions for (can be the same as all_labels)
// labels_to_show -> Must be the same as the 'labels' list, used for UI logic
// model_path -> The path of the tensorflow.js model, which will usually contain a 'model.json' and weight files (shards)
// RGB_COLORMAP -> The colormap scheme used for gradCAM, to overlay a heatmap on the original image

// These keys will depend on the user's pre-processing function. They may or may not need to be present:
// IMG_SIZE -> The size of the image as per pre-processing requirements of the model
// CROP_SIZE -> The crop size of the image as per pre-processing requirements of the model

// GUI_WAITTIME -> The wait time used for sleep calls within the platform to keep the UI smooth during certain operationss

// Model calibration / scaling: Once a prediction is made, the user can choose to apply model calibration/scaling. The
// Stanford module does so by applying a piecewise linear function based on operating points generated from the CheXpert 
// holdout set. For each label, we maximize the difference between true positive and false positive rate. to get an op. point.
// Here are the config keys that correspond to the scaling/calibration process. 
// op_points -> List of operating points of the model. Used for post-processing model calibration.
// MAX_VAL -> Maximum probability value that any prediction can reach. 
// SCALE_MIN -> Threshold above which a processed output is scaled by a multiplier. 
// SCALE_UPPER -> A multiplier to scale a processed prediction value.
